<div id="0"></div>

A project using FuzzyLogic (`jFuzzyLogic` library) for "Basics of Artificial Intelligence" ("Podstawy Sztucznej Inteligencji") course of Computer Science Bachelor's at AGH Academy of Science and Technology.

Contains:
- fuzzy logic driver
- minigame controlled by evaluated values

Minigame:
- "main character" is the biggest circle in the middle
- "main character" is constantly being shot at from random position around him
- each projectile / obstacle is moving in a straight line, directly towards "main character" at that specific point of time
- "main character" is using 8 of his sensors to get to know, what's around him and how far away it is
- "main character" can use his "brain" to evaluate, which direction he should go to avoid the projectiles
- "main character" doesn't like to stay in place, so he chooses to go right, whenever there's possibility for it

How to run:
- if you are using IntelliJ, it's as easy as starting the default loaded configuration `CompileAndRun`
- if you are using other IDE, you need to start `task runWithExecJarExecutable` - your application will compile and run automatically
